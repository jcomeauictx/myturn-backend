# Myturn Backend

Open source collaborative upgrade of David Stodolsky's (https://github.com/dstodoksky/myturnb)[myturnb] project.

This requires NodeJS version 6 or higher, due to use of `const` expressions like that found on (https://github.com/MyTurn-OpenSource/myturn-backend/blob/master/app/group/groupSockets.js#L7)[line 7 of `app/group/groupSockets.js`].
